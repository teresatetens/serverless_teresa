## Learning GitHub

*This week, you will be going through steps to set up tools needed to be successful in this camp. If you are already familiar with some, feel free to skip to the end and complete the task to move on.*

### GitHub

<details>
<summary><b>:question: What is Github?</b></summary>
</br>

GitHub is a platform that is widely used in the tech industry, that enables code hosting and makes collaboration for coding a seamless process. You can use GitHub to manage your files, changes in your project, version control (the ability to revert back to previous versions of your code as well as versions developed by other programmers), and more.

[Get started with GitHub](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/)
<br></br>
Check out <a href="https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/">"The Github Flow"</a> for more information on issues, pull requests, committing, and branches!
<br><br/>

<summary>:exclamation: Help! I don't know how to use it and I need more information.</summary>
  </br>
  If you want to learn more about <b>what it is</b> and <b>how to use it,</b> try taking <a href='https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/introduction-to-github'>this</a> GitHub Learning Lab Course. After finishing it, you will have a strong understanding of all the features GitHub has to offer.
  <br><br/>

**One very important rule...**
*Don't* work on your code in the web editor. This is bad practice, and you will regret it later.
<details>
<summary>:question: What should I do instead?</summary>
  </br>
Install <a href='https://desktop.github.com/'>Github Desktop</a> and commit from your local computer. We'll go over code editors next if you don't have one to work on your code locally. You can also use <a href='http://kbroman.org/github_tutorial/pages/first_time.html'>git on your commandline</a>.

## **:pencil: Task 1: Create a new branch named `test`, add a sentence introducing yourself to the end of the README.md file, and commit the change to `test`. Then, make a pull request to your main branch and merge the edits.**

**Pull Request Guidelines**
* Name the Pull Request `Adding self introduction`
* In the description, place a sentence describing what the Pull Request contributes to the main branch.

Key functions you should be familiar with after this task include:
- Committing changes
- Forking a repository
- Making a new branch
- Making a pull request

## **:camping: To move on, make sure you commit the change and merge the branch!**
