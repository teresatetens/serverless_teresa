## Week 2 Step 8

### Using the Twillio API
Now that your account and coding environments are set up, it is time to get to work! As a reminder, you are using the Twilio API to send Face API data as a text message.

### 📝 Task 1: Connect your Twilio profile to your code 
<details>
<summary>❓Where do I begin?</summary>
</br>
In your function but outside of the module, declare 3 constants: one for your account SID, another for your auth token, and the last for the twilio client.
</details>
<br>
Make sure to instantiate constants handling your account information **environment variables** rather than the actual values. 
</br>
<details>
<summary>❓Where do I find the auth token and account SID?</summary>
</br>
The auth token and account SIDs are found on your twilio dashboard: https://www.twilio.com/console. 
</details>
<details>
<summary>❓How do I import Twilio?</summary>
</br>
Check you that you have installed Twilio through npm by typing `twilio --version` in your terminal. Afterwards, instantiate the `client` constant you declared to require the Twilio package. Pass in the account SID and auth token as parameters.
</details>

### 📝 Task 2: Send a message using Twilio API 
<details>
<summary>❓Need a hint?</summary>
</br>
Look at the functions your client can perform. If you are stuck, you can refer to the Twilio API at https://www.twilio.com/docs/sms.
</details>
<details>
<summary>❓What parameters do I need?</summary>
</br>
Make sure to at least have a `body` (the message you are sending) and the `from` (your twilio phone number) in the function.  
</details>

### 📝 Task 3: Send Face API data to your phone.
Send a text message with a body that describes the emotion on an inputted image based on Face API results, such as "the person in your inputted image is sad".

<details>
<summary>❓Need a hint?</summary>
</br>
You already have all the code to obtain this information, along with some other pieces of data. To isolate the emotion, look at the format of the returned information and pick out what you need.
