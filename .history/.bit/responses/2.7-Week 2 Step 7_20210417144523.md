## Week 2 Step 7

### Setting up the Twilio API
Twilio is a cloud communication platform used to **programmatically** send SMS messages, calls, etc. You will be using the Twillio API to send yourself information from the Face data you obtained in the last issue.

> **Note**: Don't worry about paying for anything, you will be receiving **10 dollars of credit from Twilio**, which is more than enough for this project. Numbers should only cost 1 dollar.
